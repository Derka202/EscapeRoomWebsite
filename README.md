# Lock and Ledger
This is a website for a non-existing escape room business. I am building it as a resume builder but also as a fun personal project
with the intention of learning more about full stack development and web design

# Iterations / Goals

### 1.0.0
<!-- - Create a landing page with a hero section, header, and footer -->
<!-- - Create a responsive navbar/sidebar in the header, containing links to contact, faq, rooms, and about pages -->
<!-- - Create the pages linked in the navbar; each has a consistent navbar/header and footer that link to each other -->
<!-- - Create a "Book Room" page and buttons placed prominently on the other pages so you can reach the booking page from any other page -->
- Put 'real' content and pictures on the pages rather than empty pages and lorem ipsum text
